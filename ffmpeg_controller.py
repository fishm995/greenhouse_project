"""
ffmpeg_controller.py

This module manages the FFmpeg process that captures the camera feed and generates HLS segments.
It includes three main functions:
  1. kill_existing_ffmpeg(): Searches for and terminates any existing FFmpeg processes that match a specific command pattern.
  2. start_ffmpeg(): Kills any existing FFmpeg processes, then builds and starts a new FFmpeg process in the background.
  3. stop_ffmpeg(): Terminates the running FFmpeg process if it exists.

Note:
  - When running in the background (e.g., via nohup), any output from the print statements will be redirected to the log file specified,
    or to the default nohup.out if not redirected.
  - This module uses the 'pgrep' command to search for processes. Ensure that your environment includes this tool (most Linux systems do).

Usage:
  - Import and call start_ffmpeg() to launch the FFmpeg process.
  - Call stop_ffmpeg() when you need to stop the process.
