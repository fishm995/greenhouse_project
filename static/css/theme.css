/*
  This CSS file handles theme-related styling for the application.
  Specifically, it adds a transition effect to the <body> element.
  
  The transition property here affects two CSS properties:
    - background-color: The color behind the page content.
    - color: The text color used for content.
  
  The value "0.1s" specifies that when either of these properties change,
  the change will be animated smoothly over 0.1 seconds (i.e., 100 milliseconds).
  This is useful when toggling between light and dark themes, as it creates a smooth,
  visually appealing transition rather than an abrupt change.

body {
  transition: background-color 0.1s, color 0.1s;
}
